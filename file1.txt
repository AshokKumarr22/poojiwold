Install gitbash and create a github account
  -> git --v / git --version : to verify the installation process is done successfully


we can use git and github in 2 cases:
  -> cloning already existed repo
  -> creating a new repo
          * creating a new files
	  * upload existed project directly


#create a newfolder (as gitbash) take this folder as path and open gitbashhere 


Method -1:
---------
cloning already existed repo process :
------------------------------------
# FRom github we will copy the https code and enter in local by using "git clone" command
    -> git clone : creating a entire copy of our existed repo without touching sourcecode 
                   *git clone url
# our existed repo is stored in our folder
# change into existed folder path by using " cd " linux command
# now we can make changes add ,commit and push into remote by using some commands
    

    working directory                  staging area                              local repo                      remote repo
    ----------------                    ----------                                --------                        --------
    
    
                         add                               commit -m" "                              push
    modified files    --------->   saves modified files   -------------->   records saved files   --------->   stores our files 


# working directory : working directory is the place where we modified changes in files and here we cant track the files
# staging area : staging area is the place where the modified files are saved and here we can track the files
# local repo : local repo is the place where we commit our saved files by using commit command
# remote repo : here our files is stored and it is the place where we existed our code


git commands :
------------
1. git add : to add the modified files into staging area
             # git add filename : to add specific file
	     # git add . : to add all files
2. git commit : records the saved files into local repo with a descriptive message
             # git commit -m " msg "
3. git push : used to send the files\modified files into remote repo
             # git push : pushing to master
	     # git push -u origin branchname : for specific branch
