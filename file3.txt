# Method -2:
-----------
# creating a new repo :
   ----------------
 # Local repo process :
    ---------------
   # create a new folder and open gitbash 
   # create a new folder named as sampleproject by using mkdir command
   # change to that directory using cd command
   # enter git init to create a new repo locally
        * git init : creating a new repo locally
   # now .git hidden file created , here our files are saved
   # by using ls -al command,we can see our hidden files


 # Remote repo process :
    ----------------
   # create a new repo named with local repo foldername and set as public 
   # new repo created and fetch it with local repo by using "git remote add url"


 # local repo process :
   -----------------
  -> create a new file named as file1.txt by touch command
        *touch : create a newfile
	*vi : open a file for editing
	*vim : create and open a file
	*ls : list all files
	*ls -al : it shows hidden files
	*cat : it displays the content of the file

  -> now check git status : it shows the status of working directory and staging area
  -> do git add , commit and push into remote repo
  -> but it comes error becuase we didnt map it to remote repo
  -> we use "git remote add url" for mapping , clone the url from remote repo
  -> now we can push it into remote repo
